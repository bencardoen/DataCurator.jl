# ["smlm_alignment",".csv", "is_thunderstorm", 500, 5, 1, 15]
# 500 = max distance between fiducials
# 5 = max number of fiducials to use
# The below only are implemented for Thunderstorm
# 1 = Focal plane (z) limiting (mode +- std)
# 15 = Maximum tolerable precision (nm)

# "image_colocalization", 3, "C[1,2].tif", "is_2d_img", "filter", 1
# 3 refers to the window size to use in colocalization
# "filter" runs a basic adaptive intensity filter (mean + k std) on the images before colocalization.
# 1 = k, so here each channel has pixels removed if their intensity (point cloud density) is lower than u + 1 std
# alternatively, you can also say ..., "segment", 1 to run otsu thresholding on the images before colocalization, the `1' scales the otsu threshold value, higher is more stringent, lower is less stringent
